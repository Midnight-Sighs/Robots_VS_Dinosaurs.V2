# Robots_VS_Dinosaurs

Welcome to Robots vs Dinosaurs. This is where you'll pick one or the other and try to bash them! Let's be honest, the dinosaurs should win every time but Roombas may put up quite the fight!

# Robots vs Dinosaurs V2.0

---

- Next I want to add different types of list for the player to pick from of robots and dinosaurs

  - Added multiple fleet/herd choices to pick from.

- Players will be able to choose what their active creature is and choose whether they want to attack and defend. The battle will be broken up into different stages.

temp notes(XXXI need to add defense option. Display for stats of active creature and creature lists. explanation of turn options. Divide the turn into seperate functions)
